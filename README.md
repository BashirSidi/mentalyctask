## Features

The application has the following features:

- It represents a file upload interface with a progress bar for tracking the processing state of the current file
- It has 3 components - main container, upload component (button + modal) and progress component
- When the main “Upload” button is pressed, a modal window opens.
- Selecting a note type from the drop down menu and adding a name, enables the “upload” (we will skip the actual file for now)
- Once a file has been uploaded the modal closes and the user sees a table of all processing files, with a progress bar representing the processing state of each task
- Each processing task can be canceled with a delete button
- Each progress bar update with a fake timer. Different progress bars are independent from each other and their progress processes independently. When a bar reaches 100% it disappears from the list
- The design is responsive so it will resize well for different desktop screen sizes and also have a mobile version
